# Wine Quality Dataset Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze two wine datasets: one for red wine and one for white wine. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of the relationships between wine chemical properties and their quality ratings.

### Datasets
The datasets used in this project are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- **Red Wine Dataset**: Contains 1599 samples of red wine with 11 features related to the wine's chemical composition.
- **White Wine Dataset**: Contains 4898 samples of white wine with the same 11 features.

Each dataset has the following features:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- **Quality** (target variable): A score between 0 and 10.

### Files in the Repository
- `is362_KMolina_Project2.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of the wine quality datasets.
- `winequality-red.csv`: The red wine dataset.
- `winequality-white.csv`: The white wine dataset.

### Project Structure
The notebook is divided into several parts:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the datasets and project goals.
2. **Data Loading**: Importing and inspecting the datasets.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Checking for missing values and validating data types.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of wine quality and relationships between features like alcohol, pH, and quality.
5. **Conclusion**: A summary of insights gained from the analysis.
